# Domain Driven Design / DDD

## What is DDD?

DDD, or Domain-Driven Design, is a software design approach that focuses on complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts. It prioritizes the domain and domain logic, basing the design on the domain itself rather than the technology used to implement the system. DDD involves a close collaboration between technical experts and domain experts to improve the model and make it more relevant and useful, ensuring the software is deeply aligned with the business strategy. This approach helps in tackling complex designs by dividing them into smaller, more manageable subdomains, promoting a ubiquitous language for all stakeholders, and fostering a deep understanding of the domain itself, which leads to more effective and relevant software solutions.

**DDD is a design pattern for business system.**

## What is domain?

In the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a **domain** refers to the sphere of knowledge and activity around which the intent of a software application is centered. It embodies the problems and solutions relevant to the business or area of interest being addressed by the system. Understanding the domain is crucial for developing software that meets the real-world needs of its users and stakeholders.
