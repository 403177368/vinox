#### Why Use Fish Shell

Fish Shell, short for "friendly interactive shell," is a feature-rich command-line interface designed for modern users. Here are several reasons why you might consider using Fish Shell:

**User-Friendly Design**

Fish boasts an easy-to-understand and user-friendly design, making it accessible for beginners while also being powerful enough for advanced users.

**Auto-suggestions**

One of the standout features of Fish is its intelligent auto-suggestions. As you type, Fish will suggest commands based on history and completions, increasing efficiency.

**Syntax Highlighting**

Fish automatically adds syntax highlighting to your commands, making it easier to read and catch mistakes.

**Powerful Scripting**

While Fish uses a different scripting language from traditional shells like bash, it's designed to be more straightforward and easier to understand, providing powerful scripting capabilities.

**Extensible and Customizable**

Fish can be easily extended with new functions, completions, and prompts. It also supports a wide array of customizations to tailor your experience.

**Web-Based Configuration**

Unlike other shells, Fish offers a web-based configuration tool, allowing you to configure your shell from a web interface.

You can read more about Fish Shell and its features in the article by Ruan Yifeng linked before.

**Installation**

Fish can be easily installed on macOS using the Homebrew package manager with the command `brew install fish`.
