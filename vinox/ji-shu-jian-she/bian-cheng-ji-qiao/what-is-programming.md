# What Is Programming?

## Programming: Data Structures Plus Algorithms

Programming at its core can be distilled into two fundamental components: data structures and algorithms. The symbiotic relationship between these two elements is what drives the functionality of any software application.

### Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that we can perform operations on it efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure has its specific use case and operations which it can perform effectively.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is essentially a formula for solving a specific kind of problem. Examples include sorting algorithms like quicksort or merge sort, search algorithms like binary search, and algorithms that powers complex operations in databases or cryptography.

### The Interplay

When creating a software program, developers choose data structures based on what the data will represent and how it will be used. Algorithms are then created or implemented to manipulate this data, solving problems and adding functionality to the program. One cannot function without the other. Efficient algorithms require the selection of the right data structures, and data structures are useless without the proper algorithms to utilize them. Combining these two facets effectively is what good programming is all about.
