# Procedure Oriented Programming

### Procedure Oriented Programming

Procedure oriented programming (POP) is a programming paradigm based around the concept of procedures. These procedures, also known as routines or functions, are a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

#### Key Concepts of POP

* **Procedures**: Also called functions, methods, or subroutines.
* **Modularity**: The program is divided into separate functions for each functional unit.
* **Scope and Lifetime**: Variables and functions have a certain scope and lifetime within the program.
* **Sequential Execution**: Instructions are executed sequentially one after the other.

#### Advantages of Procedure Oriented Programming

* **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and manage due to modularity.
* **Maintenance**: Easier to update and modify.
* **Reusability**: Functions can be reused in different parts of the program.

#### Disadvantages

* **Scalability**: Can become difficult to manage with increase in program size.
* **Data Security**: Not as secure as object-oriented programming as data can be freely accessed throughout the program.

#### Example Languages

* C
* BASIC
* FORTRAN
* Pascal
