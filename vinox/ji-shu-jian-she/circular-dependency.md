# Circular Dependency

#### Circular Dependency

Circular dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other directly or indirectly, creating a cycle. This situation can lead to problems such as the inability to compile or deploy software, runtime errors, and difficulties in maintenance.

For example:

* Module A requires Module B to function.
* Module B requires Module C to function.
* Module C requires Module A to function.

Here, we have a circular dependency because they create a closed loop of interdependencies. To resolve circular dependencies, it's essential to refactor the code to break the dependency cycle, often by using design patterns like Dependency Injection or events.

```javascript
// Example of circular dependency in JavaScript

// file: moduleA.js
const B = require('./moduleB');
exports.moduleAFunction = function() {
  // Module A functionality that uses Module B
  B.moduleBFunction();
};

// file: moduleB.js
const C = require('./moduleC');
exports.moduleBFunction = function() {
  // Module B functionality that uses Module C
  C.moduleCFunction();
};

// file: moduleC.js
const A = require('./moduleA');
exports.moduleCFunction = function() {
  // Module C functionality that uses Module A
  A.moduleAFunction();
};
```

#### Strategies to Avoid Circular Dependencies

To prevent the issues caused by circular dependencies, consider the following approaches:

**Refactoring**

Refactor the codebase to remove circular references. This might involve:

* Redesigning the module relationships to make them unidirectional.
* Combining modules that are tightly coupled into a single module.
* Extracting the shared functionality into a separate module that does not participate in the cycle.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**

Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states:

* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

By depending on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, modules are less likely to become tightly coupled.

**Dependency Injection**

Implement Dependency Injection to manage object creation and dependencies:

* Pass dependencies into a module's constructor or methods rather than having the module create or locate the dependencies.
* Use a dependency injection container to manage and inject dependencies.

**Design Patterns**

Consider using design patterns that can help to break tight coupling:

* The **Observer pattern** allows for communication between modules without requiring them to be directly aware of each other.
* The **Mediator pattern** can centralize complex communications and control between related modules.

**Services and Interfaces**

* Abstract common functionality into services that act as interfaces between modules.
* Use interface segregation to create targeted and minimal interfaces for client modules.

By incorporating these strategies, you can design a system with a robust structure that minimizes or eliminates circular dependencies.
