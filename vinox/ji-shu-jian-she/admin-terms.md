# Admin Terms

#### RBAC

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system of managing user access to resources based on their roles within an organization. In an RBAC model, access to system resources, such as files, databases, and applications, is granted based on roles assigned to individual users. Roles are defined according to job competencies, authority, and responsibilities within the business context.

#### Role

A **Role** in RBAC represents a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles simplify the process of access management because they allow administrators to manage users with similar access needs collectively. By assigning a user to a role, that user acquires the permissions associated with that role, thus enabling them to perform their duties within the system.

#### Permission

In the context of an admin system, a **Permission** is a fundamental security setting that defines the level of access or control a user has over specific resources within the system. Permissions determine what actions a user can perform, such as viewing, creating, editing, or deleting data. They are usually granular and can be assigned directly to users or, more commonly, through roles as part of a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Permissions ensure that users have the right level of access required to perform their tasks, without compromising the security or integrity of the system. They are essential for enforcing the principle of least privilege, where users are given only the access necessary to perform their job functions.
